        <div class="content-block">
          <h3>Based on Author's experience irrespective of the country and institute:</h3>
          <ul class="benefits-list">
            <li>The engineering institutes can give only theoretical knowledge to students. But there is some important theoretical knowledge which is not taught in any educational institute.</li>
            <li>Therefore the fresh graduates coming to the industry don't poses knowledge required to carry out various engineering tasks.</li>
            <li>The practical knowledge can only be obtained by working in the industry.</li>
            <li>Many companies don't have good training programs for fresh graduates, junior and senior engineers to provide required practical knowledge.</li>
            <li>Engineers don't use common sense and logic. They lack analytical ability.</li>
            <li>Therefore standard of electrical engineers is poor. Ninety percent or more electrical engineers have no knowledge or substandard knowledge or poor knowledge. They are just copy and paste masters.</li>
            <li>Books giving technical knowledge which is good, practical and covering many topics are not available.</li>
            <li>Many training programs charge hefty money for crap technical knowledge and that too about few topics.</li>
            <li>Companies don't want to invest in good training programs. One of the reason being fear of staff turnover.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="conclusion-block">
          <p>Therefore there is a need for good course material for personal as well as corporate level quality improvement of engineers. The course material available on our website serves this purpose well and beyond the expectations.</p>
          
          <p>The author has taught this material to many working engineers and students. Their feedback is positive. The range of topics and quality of contents is excellent. The knowledge is based on projects of various types and in many countries. It is absolutely hands-on and practical knowledge.</p>
          
          <p>The world is increasingly becoming competitive. Therefore an individual, engineering institute and business needs a differentiator to standout against competition. The knowledge in these documents will make an engineering student, engineer and organization standout.</p>
